The beginnings of a vim plugin for working with Sage (sagemath.org).

Syntax highlighting:

    - Uses the default syntax highlighting for python files, except that the
      docstrings use some RST highlighting
    - This is done by creating a syntax file in after

Folding:

    - modified the standard python folding to fold documentation strings

Compiler:

    - use vim's make to launch doctests and open errors in a quickfix window

Todo:

    - move file type detection to here from .vimrc
    - move syntax file from under after; it should just load the python syntax
    - improve support for working with the compiler
